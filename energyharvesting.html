    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; max-width: 65ch;"> I'm working on a wearable project and looking into possibilities to converts the heat waste generated by a scream into low voltage power. As part of the reserach, I've spent the last months familiarizing with the concept of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/energy-harvesting" style="color: rgb(9, 9, 9);"></a> energy harvesting.</p>  
    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; max-width: 65ch;">I ran two experiments in my kitchen using the Peltier module as a thermoelectric generator (TEG) and thermoelectric cooler (TEC). 
    Below images of my favourite accidents so far...</p>

    <p>Testing Seeback effect (discovered in 1821 by Thomas Johann Seebeck... of course); in thermoelectric generators, it takes a temperature difference and turns it into electrical power</p>

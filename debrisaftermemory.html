     <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; max-width: 65ch;"> // unrehearsed filming; can provide a sense of dynamism, immersion and instability.</p> 
     <h1 style="color:rgb(8, 8, 8);font-size:40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif, monospace; max-width: 65ch;">This short evokes a poetic of the elements that make visible the mechanics of reality and the symbolism 
      in the built environment. The filming technique exists in the ambiguous space between documentary and cinematic realism. Debris resulting from subtractive processes 
      become a tool of storytelling. Metal, wood, earth, water, and fire embody memory as a process in which fragments of earth, labor, 
      and emotion consolidate into a singularly charged moment. Perhaps, it's violence and how all things are shaped at will or turn to dust. 
      All of these and none of them - and what's the difference anyway, what's the core of matter; what's the truth?</h1> 
      <br>
      <h1 style="color:rgb(8, 8, 8);font-size:40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif, monospace; max-width: 65ch;">This is, 
      indeed, an old argument.</h1> 
      <br>
      <h1 style="color:rgb(8, 8, 8);font-size:40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif, monospace; max-width: 65ch;">Something about this video is a lot like thought. The mind spends a lifetime thinking, zooming in and out. 
        So who knows what lies beyond the camera, what's left after memory.</h1> 
      <br>
      <h1 style="color:rgb(8, 8, 8);font-size:40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif, monospace; max-width: 65ch;">The music manifests and hides. This may be the way how thoughts work. In sliding scales. At tempo. In panicked drones. There are no breakthroughs here. 
      It is a work that harbors secrets and emotions between striking notes of tension and release. Like music.</h1>

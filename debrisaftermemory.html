     <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; max-width: 80ch;">unrehearsed filming; can provide a sense of dynamism, immersion and instability.</p> 
     <h1 style="color:rgb(8, 8, 8);font-size:30px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif, monospace; max-width: 65ch;">This audio-visual short evokes a poetic of the elements that make visible some of the mechanics of reality and the symbolism 
      in the built environment.</h1> 
      <h1 style="color:rgb(8, 8, 8);font-size:30px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif, monospace; max-width: 65ch;">Debris 
      becomes a storytelling entity. Perhaps, it's violence and how all things are shaped at will or turn to dust. 
      All of these and none of them - and what's the difference anyway, what is matter, what is truth?</h1> 
      <h1 style="color:rgb(8, 8, 8);font-size:30px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif, monospace; max-width: 65ch;">This is, 
      indeed, an old argument.</h1> 
      <h1 style="color:rgb(8, 8, 8);font-size:30px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif, monospace; max-width: 65ch;">Something about this video feels a lot like thought. The mind spends a lifetime thinking, 
        zooming in and out and nothing of reality’s essence is broken. So who knows what lies beyond the frame, what is left after memory. 
        The music manifests and hides. This may be the way how thoughts work. In sliding scales. At tempo. In panicked drones. 
        There are no breakthroughs here. It’s a work that harbors secrets and emotions between striking notes of tension and release. Like music.</h1>

      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; max-width: 80ch;">Drifting between post-phenomenology studies and artistic research, this audio-visual short uses agential realism to approach thinking with, through, and about the built environment. 
      Following Karen Barad’s dedication to diffraction as a form of critique, it superposes various camera choreographies in the longing that their consonances and dissonances can stimulate novel ways of engaging with
      and perceiving the built environment as a cultural and material agent. It takes from the intertwined physical and metaphysical curiosities that characterize Barad’s work, proposing an engagement with the temporal and spatial (dis)continuities 
      that matter helps to understand.</p> 
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; max-width: 80ch;">Enormous amounts of materials and energy are embedded in the built environment. As our technological systems scale up, 
        can they bring configurations that are regenerative by design? What if we understood our reality to be much more bound up and reactive to our perceptions 
        and intentions - shifting at levels and in ways that were not entirely predictable? How can this build up our confidence in making a change?</p> 
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; max-width: 80ch;">Filmed using the handheld camera technique, the audio-visual narrative explore possibilities of shifts in perspectives through the reconfiguration of relations of scale, exteriority, 
        and connectivity. In a post-phenomenological sense, what is produced by the video camera is an immediate and live ‘taking in’ of the world shaped by the technical/perceptual apparatus 
       of the camera – just as the human nervous system shapes the visions that seem to ‘hit’ the eye.</p> 
       <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; max-width: 80ch;">Shot on a family-run workshop in southern Italy, this piece is a commentary on the idea of scale and human development within the context of the global energy crisis amid supply chain shortages
        and the rising costs of raw materials.</p>

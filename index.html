       <aside>Dear reader, I consider it a privilege to be in the midst of your day!    
        I'm an artist and cultural publicist operating at the intersection of music,
        video, performance, digital culture and technology. 
        
        I run KO-HUM, a communication agency committed to promote and facilitate
        the development of projects in collaboration with cultural producers and artists who 
        resist the atomization of culture and, through sustained inquiry and creative research endeavor 
        to enrich the public sphere.
        
        Another part of what I spend time working on is an alternative language I can use to
        think and talk about our socities. My practice assembles influences from science studies, 
        media theory, and philosophy. Subjects of exploration include interpersonal 
        communication, signs, symbols, representation of words and ideas, real 
        and imagined, oral and written, sense and perception. This process often results 
        in the creation of performances, video and sound works.

        I graduated in Economics at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome, and completed a dual masters dregree 
        in International Management at SHR Berlin and INSEEC Paris. I'm currently a MA student
        at the Interface Cultures departmenet of the University of Art & Design in Linz.

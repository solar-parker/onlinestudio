      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; max-width: 65ch;"> Collecting raindrops. I spent most of my childhood in the South of Italy where sunny days are the norm. I used to dislike rain and only made peace with it
      after years of living in Germany. This project is a personal tribute to and celebration of this water-based phenomena.</p> 
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; max-width: 65ch;"> This tiny jar contains raindrops fallen above the Donaul√§nde (Linz) on the afternoon of Sunday, April 24th, 2022. </p>

        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; max-width: 65ch;"> I came back revisiting this project. The images below are microscopic
          views of the raindrops collected in April. The patterns should be deposits of dust particles.  
          I was unable to spot microorganisms inside (I kept the raindrops in the fridge). 
          Somewhere inside of every raindrop is a tiny impurty. In my understanding, these particles are relevant to the raindrop's existence because water vapor can't condense into droplets on its own. 
          The entire process is described in the book by <a href="https://www.academia.edu/25583883/H._R._Pruppacher_and_J._D._Klett_Microphysics_of_Clouds_and_Precipitation" style="color: rgb(9, 9, 9);">Prupacher and Klett: Microphysics of Clouds and Precipitation.</a></p>

          <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; max-width: 65ch;">update 29.06.2022</p>
          <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; max-width: 65ch;"> Below images of litmus paper tests (a quick method of determining whether a liquid solution is acidic 
          or basic/alkaline). Their pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. The readings are based around a pH of 7, which is neutral (like pure water). This scale might seem small, but each level 
          is 10 times bigger than the next; a pH of 9 is 10 times more alkaline than a pH of 8. A pH of 2 is 10 times more acidic than a pH of 3, and 100 times more acidic than a reading of 4. I tested 
          a sample of tap water (blueish stripe on the left) and a raindrop (yellowish, light-green stripe on the right). </p>

     in black ink saying tap water. The light green limtus paper on the right reports a tag saying raindrop." width="500" height="667">

      <br>
      <br>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; max-width: 65ch;">The rainwater's ph reached 7 (neutral solution have a pH of 7); tap water reached a value between 8 and 10 (it is more alkalinic than the rainwater sample). 
        Life on earth depends on appropriate pH levels in and around living organisms and cells. The human body, our bag of bones, muscles, sinews, organs, and the countless other doo-dads that make up this system 
        works constantly to control pH levels of blood and other fluids.</p>
